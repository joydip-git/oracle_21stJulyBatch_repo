1. create a class to represent an employee
	data: name, id, basicPayment, daPayment, hraPayment
	constructors: default and parameterized (for all the data members)
	methods: to calculate total salary
	arguments: None
	return type: float

2. create two child classes of employee:
	a. developer:
	data: name, id, basicPayment, daPayment, hraPayment, incentivePayment
	constructors: default and parameterized (for all the data members)
	methods: to calculate total salary
	arguments: None
	return type: float

	b. hr: 
   data: name, id, basicPayment, daPayment, hraPayment, gratuityPayment
	constructors: default and parameterized (for all the data members)
	methods: to calculate total salary
	arguments: None
	return type: float

3. from main method, use this class to create few instances
	a. ask user how many instances to create
	b. create an array to store references of the instances of the hr and developer
   c. create instances and store each of them in the array
   d. iterate through the array and pick up one employee (eithet hr or developer) reference at a time. call method to calculate salary and print the salary along with the name of the employee
   format: <emp-name> has salary of <salary-value>

Update First App:
----------------------------------
in the existing FirstApp application, in the Calculation.java file, add 3 more functions:
subtract, multiply and divide
all these methods will accept two arguments of type int and returns the calculated value (subtraction or division or multiplication result) of type int

call those 4 methods from main method in Program.java file, based on choice from user

1. print the choices to the user
2. ask user to enter choice
3. based on the entered choice, call a method (add/subtract/multiply/divide). before that ask user to enter two numbers
Note: in divide method always divide highest value by the lowest value, no matter which one is the first and which one is the second argument
4. this calculation should run as long as user does not want to continue

1. basics of Java (Java Fundamentals)
2. OOP in Java
3. post-OOP in Java (exception handling)


1. creating a basic application
2. understand the application coding, compile, run etc. through notepad
3. Execution cyle of Java
4. how to write methods including arguments and return values, call methods
5. static and instance methods of class
6. main method
7. how to create application in Eclipse
8. data types - primitive and non-primitive

9. more on data types: reference and value type
10. operators
11. control flow statements
12. array

value type: generally the primitive types, since they directly store values in their memory block, are known as value types
reference type: generally the non-primitive types, since they do not store the value (like, an object or string data etc.) in the memory blocks directly. rather they store the address of those values (which are stored in heap memory region)


operators:
type based on functionality:
	arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
	relational: 
		comparison: >, <, >=, <=, instanceof
		equality: ==, !=
	logical: 
		AND: &&, 
		OR: ||
	assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, ^=, |=, <<=, >>=, >>>=
	shift: <<, >>, >>>
	bitwise: 
		AND: &
		exclusive OR: ^
		inclusive OR: |

types based on number of operands:
unary:
	postfix: expr++, expr--
	prefix: ++expr, --expr, +expr, -expr, ~, !
binary: expr1 + expr2, etc.
ternary: ?:

int a = 10
int b = 20
int c = a > b? a:b;

int x = a + b;

a++ => a = a+1
--b=> b = b-1

int y=0;
y +=a;

control flow statements:
a. Decision making statements:
	i. if statement, if...else statements, nested if..else 
	ii. switch statement
b. loop statements:
	i. while loop
	ii. do...while loop
	iii. for loop
	iv. for-each loop
c. Jump statements:
	i. break
	ii. continue

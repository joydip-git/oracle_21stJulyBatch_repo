JS=> dynamic, loosely typed programming language

2015:
	const, let

functions:
	a. function declaration
	b. function expression

hoisting:
	variable hoisting: a variable is registered during JS execution phase-1 (preparation phase) and it is assigned as undefined (no value assigned yet)
			the same variable is assigned to proper value in the 2nd phase of execution (execution phase)
			if you access and print the variable before it's declaration it will be undefined 
							
	function hoisting:	
			function declaerations are hoisted, not function expressions
			during the 1st phase (preparation), the function is hoisted (a variable is decalared iwth the name of that function and that variable starts referreing to the function immediately)
			but being an expression, the expression variable in the function expression is hoisted with value undefined and that variable is assigned the function reference later in the 2nd stage
			hence, the function written using function decalaration can be called before the declaration, whereas, the function written using function expression, can be called only after the exression.

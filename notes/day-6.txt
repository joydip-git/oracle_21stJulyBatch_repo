XML:
Extensible Markup Language
Text-based markup language
data-describing language, it does not describe how to display data (which is the job of HTML), rather than, it defines data

HTML: designing (design markup/design formatting)

XML tags: user-defined tags
purpose: define a data structrure, used to store and oragnize data

characterestics:
a. XML is extensible
b. XML carries/represents data, does not represent it
c. XML is public/open standard (developed by w3c)


Usgaes:
configuration of web applications using xml
as medium of exchange of data between two parties
easily offload and reload data into database
this XML data can be presented by any way necessary
can be easily merged with stylesheets
any type of data can be expressed in the form of XML



XML file:
	syntax rules:
		XML declaration
		references (a DTD/Schema)
		tags or elements or nodes 
		attributes
		texts

	XML declaration rules:
	 - is case sensitive, <?xml...?>, "xml" should be in lower case
	 - first statement in XML file
	 - if XML is being used as medium of data transfer between the parties over HTTP protocol, then HTTp protocol can override the value of encoding

	references declaration:
		reference to XML schema or DTD file
		should be after the XML decalartion and before root element

	elements/tags/nodes:, 
		if child element or text: <element>....</element>
	   if no child element or text (empty tag): <elementname />
		elements are case-sensitive <employee> different from <Employee>

	nesting elements: children elements must not overlap
	<employees>
			<employee id="100">
					<name>...</name>
			<employee id="101">
					<name>...</name>
					<salary>...</salary>
			<salary>2000</salary>
			</empoyee>
			</employee>
	</employees>

	attributes:
		key-value (name-value) pair
		depicts a property of an element
		case sensitive
		attribute names are not mentioned in quotes
		same attribute can be used twice with an element

	

	XML References:
		>,<,& etc.

		6>3

		entity reference: &name; where name is predfined string of text and/or markup
		example: &lt; &gt; &amp; &copy; &apos; &quot;
		6 &gt; 3

		character reference: &#number; => where number is a number value which represents a unicode character
		&#65; => A


		A.document prologue => xml declaration + reference declaration => 
		B.elements section

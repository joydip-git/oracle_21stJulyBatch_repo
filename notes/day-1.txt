Tally is an application
Amazon is website

design: HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
styling: CSS (Cascading Stylesheet)
code:  JavaScript

Code: lines of instruction about what your application does
such as: what happens if a "Visit Google" link (anchor or a) on the webapage is clicked

Notepad: a desktop application

code: is written using a programming language, like, JavaScript
But any code might be written in human understandable way, but finally is converted to machine level language, i.e. in terms of 0s and 1s

0 => 00000000
1 => 00000001
2 => 00000010
3 => 00000011

A->Z
a->z
@, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), -, +

memory address: hexadecimal => 0XS23D4R5
chip: Embded C++

programming languages and techniques:
C, C++, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go language (From Google), Swift etc.
OOP (Object-oriented programming) languages: Java, C++, C# etc.
Java

Softwares:
a. Application s/w
b. System s/w

different programming language categories:
a. functional/procedural: C 
b. declarative: SQL etc.
c. OOP language: C++, Java, C# etc.
d. Object-based programming language: JavaScript etc.
etc.

languages:
a. High-level
b. assembly level
c. low/machine level language


add two numbers and display the result

plan for application:
way of representing logic: algorithm  and flowchart (digramatical representation)

a. declare two "variables" to store values
b. add those two values
c. declare another "variable" to store the result
d. print the result

variables => name(identifiers) of memory blocks, where values can be stored temporarily during the time application is running

variable => it is nothing but name of a container to store a value
process  => a memory block assigned to the application (from RAM), so that application related data can be stored
application related data will stored in memory blocks of that process
we can pass the instruction to allcoate some memory blocks to store some values temporarily from our code written using some programming language

operations:
1. addition
2. subtraction
3. multiplication
4. division
5. square
etc.


function: lines of instruction to do something
//addition instruction sets (code)
//x and y = > variables to store passed values (arguments)
//result=> a local (locally declared inside this function) variable, but it is not an argument
function add(x, y)
{
	var result = x + y
	alert(result)
}

//subtraction instruction sets (code)
function subtract(x, y)
{
	var result = x + y
   return result
}

//multiplication instruction sets (code)
function multiply()
{
}

//division instruction sets (code)
function divide(x, y)
{
}

add(x,y)
	begin
	
	end

function main(){
	var a = 1123456789
	var b = 20
	//parameters (a, b)
	add(a,b)
	var subRes = subtract(a,b)
	multiply()
	divide(a,b)
}

data => information
types of data: numerical, fractional numerical value, series of characters (string), character, boolean (0/1, true/false etc.)

0/1
=> 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111

2^8 => 0 => 255

2^64

0 => 65535 (65536)

1 bit
1 byte = 8 bits

2 bytes = 16 bits

4 bytes = 32 bits


data type => indicates what type of data should be stored in memory block and what size memopry block is required for that value to be stored
int a = 1234
long b = 12345678

float f = 12.34

Programming techniques:
a. decalartive programming: Angular, React, Vue etc.
a technique to abstract away the control flow for logic which is required for a s/w to perform some action, and instead invloves stating what the task or desired result/outcome
this depends on pre-configured facilities (capabilities)in the language to accomplish a task
it focuses mainly on outcome

b. imperative programming: (Latin word, imperare = command)
focuses on the steps to achieve the outcome, Fortran, Pascal, ALGOL

c. combine decalartive and imperative programming techniques: Java, C#


num % 2 == 0

functional/procedural: C
	only procedures (functions)


OOP language: Java, C#, C++
	concept of class + functions

void getUserInput(){
	long mobileNo = <value-from-the-mobile-textbox>;
	string email = <value-from-the-email-textbox>;
	string name = <value-from-the-name-textbox>;
	string userName = <value-from-the-username-textbox>;
	string pwd = <value-from-the-password-textbox>;
}


struct User
{
   long mobileNo;
   string name;
   string email;
   string username;
   string password;
};

User nehaUser;
nehaUser.mobileNo=<value-from-the-mobile-textbox>;
nehaUser.name=<value-from-the-name-textbox>;
nehaUser.email=<value-from-the-email-textbox>;
..............

User akshayUser;

Object     (real-time entity)
Class      (Blueprint)

class Car
{
	 string modelName;
    string chasisNo;
    bool   hasAC;
    bool climateControl;
    string color;
    int seatingCapacity;

    start(){}
    stop(){}
    accelerate(){}
    putbreak(){}
}

what is compiler? compiler first of all checks entire code for any error (syntactical) and if found, it will not convert your code into either MLC or intermediate level code. If no error found, then the code will be converted into MLC or Byte-code/IL code. Turbo C/C++, Borland C/C++ compilers for C and C++, Java and C# compilers etc.

what is interpreter? interpretes code line by line and executes. if any line has issue, only that line related error will be shown and further code inmterpretation will be stopped. the previous part of the code, works smoothly. JS engine in case of JS.


what are the differences between compiler and interpreter?

Car hondaCVZ = new Car();
hondaCVZ.modelName="";
hondaCVZ.chasisNo="";
....

hondaCVZ.start();
hondaCVZ.stop();

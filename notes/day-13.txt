code which interacts with data source => data access logic => class with methods (data access layer)
code which applies some business logic on fetched data => business logic => class with methods (business layer)
code which focuses on how the data should be presented in front of the end user => presentation logic => class with methods (presentation layer)

Inversion of Control (IoC) -principle : inverting the control of creating instance of dependency factor(x) from dependent party (B) to somewhere (another class - Container) 
Dependency Injection (DI) - mechanism : supplying an instance of dependency factor (X) into the dependent party (B)

through constructor
through getter/setter
through services

interface Abs{
	string sayHello();
}

class X implements Abs{
public string sayHello(){}
}


class IocContainer{
	public static Abs create(){
		return new X();
	}
}

class B{
	public void callHello(){
		Abs obj = IocContainer.create();
		//X obj = new X();
      obj.sayHello();
   }
}

B is dependent on the instance of X
B => Dependent party
X => Dependency factor


class B{
	 private Abs _abs;
    public B(Abs abs){
		_abs = abs;
	 }
	 public void callHello(){
		_abs.sayHello();
	}
}

class B{
	 private Abs _abs;
    public B(){
	 }
    public void setAbs(Abs abs)
	 {
		_abs = abs;
	 }	
	 public void callHello(){
		_abs.sayHello();
	}
}

application must have a DI framework
will supply a container
you have to register the dependecies with the container
now, whenever any class in your application asks for DI of a depndency factor (already registered with the container), the container will create an instance of that DF and supply the same either to constructor or sette of the class.

Program => EmployeeBusinessComponent => EmployeeDataAccessObject


Reflection:
>javap java.util.ArrayList

javap tool to diassemble the class file ArrayList.java from java.util package and it dispplays the information about fields, getter/setters, constructors, methods during runtime

my application:
D:\oracle\oracle_21stJulyBatch_repo\Codes\Java-Part2\DatabaseApp\bin\com\oracle\databaseapp\bo>javap EmployeeBusinessComponent.class
=> this command will display the information about fields, getter/setters, constructors, methods during runtime

D:\oracle\oracle_21stJulyBatch_repo\Codes\Java-Part2\DatabaseApp\bin\com\oracle\databaseapp\bo>javap -c EmployeeBusinessComponent.class

=> this command will compile the the class code into byte code and will display the complete class code in terms of byte code

a mechanism of examining or modifying the behavior of a class during run time

java.lang.Class => this class provides several useful methods to extract information about a type, change the runtime behavior of the class, create instance based on the metadata of the class, invoke ctor explicitly based on constructor metadata to create instance, extract method, getter, setter, field etc. information as well as invoke them based on that metadata

Class => extract information of a type
	type-name.class syntax => use type-name.class syntax to extract type information
	Class => forName(type-name) => pass the fully-qualified type name in the forName() method


	Object => getClass(instance-of-the-type) => pass an instance of a type, from which the getClass() will extract type information


create instance based on metadata of the type

java.lang.Class=> newInstance()
java.lang.reflect.Constructor =>

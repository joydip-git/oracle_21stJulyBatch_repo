//code sample:
//class name should follow pascal casing
//class name should not use any keyword, like, Class, as the prefix or suffix with the class name
//try not to use digits or special characters in class name
//name of the class should be a noun, neither a verb nor an adjective
//method name: should following camel casing (first letter of first word in lower, followed by first letter of every other word in uppercase)
//name of the method should be a verb, neither a noun nor an adjective
//variable: name should be in camel casing style. name of the variable should be a noun, neither a verb nor an adjective

class Program{
	//static=> in order to invoke/access the member you DO NOT NEED TO CREATE AN INSTANCE of the class
	public static int main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Welcome to Java");

		//creating instance of the class
		//Calculation calcObjAddress = new Calculation();

		//calling the addNumbers method
		//pass two values (of type int) to the method, since it demands tow parameters to be passed
		//since the method returns a value, declare a variable to store the return value of the method
		int result;
		//return value of the method is assigned to the variable "result"
		//result = calcObjAddress.addNumbers(10,20);
		result = Calculation.addNumbers(10,20);
		System.out.println(result);
		return 0;
   } 
}

class Calculation{
   //public Calculation(){}

	//instance method: to call this method, create an instance of the class first and then call the method with the instance variable
	//static method: to call this method, NO NEED TO CREATE AN INSTANCE OF THJE CLASS. just use class name to call that method.
	public static int addNumbers(int first, int second){
		int additionResult;
		additionResult = first + second;
		return additionResult;

Programming Language Constructs:
a. architecture
b. compilers or interpreters
c. syntax
d. language features

Source code => compiler => machine level language code (CPU dependent)/intermediate language code (CPU independent) [will be placed inside an output file with extension .exe in case of executable application or .dll/.h/.tlb in case of library application]
can contain single file/multiple files
procedural language or OOP language
built-in functionalities (part of library)
	- functionality for printing output in the console
	- functionality for accepting input from the console
	- functionality for handling files
	- functionality for concurrent programming

applications: 
- executable (Stand-alone) application => will have a main method
- library application (reusable) application => will NOT have any main method

calculation.h
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b){
    printf ("%d",(a+b));
}

ui.c
----------------------
#include <stdio.h> /using System;/imports system;
#include<calculaulation.h>

void main(){
 add(10,20);
}


void main(){
   int a = 100;
   getInformation();
}
void getInformation(){ 
  int x = 10;
//get some information about an employee 
}

problems with procedural programming:
a. local variables of a function occupies memory block when the function is getting executed. But they are erased as soon as the function is over. only main related local variables stay as long as the application is running.
b. the values of local variables are subject to mutation, which is bit problematic related to security
c. there is no proper way to group co-related data (though C language has a technique, known as structure to do that)


name, email, phone, company, skills

C++ => object oriented programming language

OOP and OOAD

local variables: the variables that you declare inside a function in any programming language, i.e. variables that are local to the function

person:
	a. height
	b. weight
	c. color_complexion

	a. talk
	b. run
	c. sleep
	d. walk
	e. listen

class Person{
   int height;
	int weight;
	string color;

   void Talk(){}
	void Run(){}
	void Sleep(){}
	.......
}

class: a blueprint to create real time objects (instances)
object: a real time entity containing data (characterestics) and methods (functionalities). In OOP language, the instance/object is created through a blueprint (class), which defines which properties/caharacterestics/attributes and functionalities, an object must have.


class = [data + methods] 
   => encapsulation (insider capsule) 
	=> abstraction (hiding data members => data abstraction and implementation abstraction => method implementation)

access specifiers: some keywords (public, private, protected etc.) which control accessibility of class members (data or methods)

private: members declared with private access specifier, are accessible within the class ONLY
protected: members declared with protected access specifier, are accessible within the that class and the child classes, ONLY.
public: members declared with public access specifier, are accessible within the that class and the child classes as well as outside both (complete public access)

class Person{
    //data members (global to all functionalities of the class)
	//by using private keyword, I am hiding the name of data members
    private String name;
    private float height;
    private float weight;
    private String color;
    
    //constructor method:
    //a special function to assign values to the data members (store values in memory blocks)
    //name of the function should be same as that of the class
    //the function must not return anything and unlike any other function should not have any return type at all (void/int etc.)
    //this constructor function is called DURING (not before or after) object creation
    //the following is a default constructor: the job of this default constructor function is to assign default values to the data members
    //public Person(){
        //name = null;
        //height = 0.0F;
        //weight = 0.0F;
        //color = null;
    //}
    //constructor with parameters: parameterized constructor
    public Person(String personName, float personHeight, float personWeight, String personColor){
       
        name = personName;
        height = personHeight;
        weight = personWeight;
        color = personColor;
        
    }
    //functionalities
    // this method is publicly accessible, but I am hiding what code is written inside this method
	// outsiders can call this method, but will not know what code is written inside
    public void PrintInformation(){
        System.out.println(name + " " + height + " " +" " + weight + " " + color);
        //System.out.println(height);
        //System.out.println(weight);
        //System.out.println(color);
    }
}

class HelloWorld {
    static Person Create(String pname, float pheight, float pweight, String pcolor){
        Person objAddress;
        //objAddress = new Person();
        objAddress = new Person(pname,pheight,pweight,pcolor);
        return objAddress;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!\n");
        int x = 10;
        
        Person firstObjAddress = Create("Anil",5.7F,75F,"Fair");
        Person secondObjAddress = Create("Sunil",5.5F,65F,"Pale");
        
        firstObjAddress.PrintInformation();
        secondObjAddress.PrintInformation();
        
        //firstObjAddress.name="Anil";
        //firstObjAddress.height=5.7F;
        //firstObjAddress.weight=75;
        //firstObjAddress.color="Fair";
        
        //secondObjAddress.name="Sunil";
        //secondObjAddress.height=5.5F;
        //secondObjAddress.weight=65;
        //secondObjAddress.color="Pale";
    }
}


OOP Principles:
---------------------------
a. Encapsulation and Abstraction
b. Inheritance
c. Polymorphism


Inheritance: it's way to aquire characterestics and functionalities from one class to another class.
1. the one that you are inheriting from is "base/parent" class
2. the one that you are inheriting to is "child/derived" class
3. except constructors, all the members are inherited into child from base class
4. if base class members are private, they are still inherited into the child class from base class, BUT the inherited members can't be accessed from inside the child class. in order to get that facility, declare base class members with protected access specifier.
Usage: simply to introduce code re-usability
Types: Major 3 types => Single-level/Simple, Multi-level, Multiple
Note: Multiple inheritance is not supported in many languages, such as, Java, C#, JavaScript etc. and supported in languages like C++

BankAccount
----------------------------------------
properties:   acc_holder_name, acc_id, current_balance
functionality: withdraw(), deposit()

SavingsBankAccount => BankAccount																					
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
properties:    [extra properties: minimum_balance,  roi]
functionality: [extra methods: calculateInterest()]

CurrentBankAccount => BankAccount			
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
properties:    [extra properties: overdraft]
functionality: [extra methods]

Other Example:
// Online Java Compiler
class Employee{
    
    protected String name;
    protected int id;
    protected float basicPayment;
    protected float daPayment;
    protected float hraPayment;
    
    public float calculateSalary(){
        
    }
}
class Developer extends Employee{
    private float incentivePayment;
    
    public Developer(){}
    
    public Developer(String nameValue, int idValue, float basicPayValue, float daPayValue, float hraPayValue, float incentivePayValue){
        
        name = nameValue;
        id = idValue;
        basicPayment = basicPayValue;
        daPayment = daPayValue;
        hraPayment = hraPayValue;
        incentivePayment = incentivePayValue;
    }
    public float calculateSalary(){
        return basicPayment+daPayment+hraPayment+incentivePayment;
    }
}
class Hr extends Employee{
    private float gratuityPayment;
    
    public Hr(){}
    
    public Hr(String nameValue, int idValue, float basicPayValue, float daPayValue, float hraPayValue, float gratuityPayValue){
        
        name = nameValue;
        id = idValue;
        basicPayment = basicPayValue;
        daPayment = daPayValue;
        gratuityPayment = gratuityPayValue;
        hraPayment = hraPayValue;
    }
    public float calculateSalary(){
        return basicPayment+daPayment+hraPayment+gratuityPayment;
    }
}
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Developer anilDevAddress = new Developer("anil",1,1000,2000,3000,4000);
        float totalSalaryOfAnil = anilDevAddress.calculateSalary();
        System.out.println(totalSalaryOfAnil);
        
        Hr sunilHrAddress = new Hr("sunil",2,2000,3000,4000,5000);
        float totalSalaryOfSunil = sunilHrAddress.calculateSalary();
        System.out.println(totalSalaryOfSunil);
    }
}


Polymorphism: Multiple forms of the same thing

method signature: <return-type> <method-name>(argument-list)

A. Static/compile-time polymorphism: 
a. function/method overloading: methods with same name, but different signature, in a class
	1. number of arguments are different
	2. data type of the arguments are different
	3. the position or order of the arguments are different
	Note: Though return type is also part of the signature of a method, but it does not play any role in differentiating the methods
b. constructor overloading: mutiple constuctors in a class with different signature

// Online Java Compiler
class Person{
    private String name;
    private int id;
    
    //constructor overloading
    //defaultr constructor
    public Person(){
        
    }
    //parameterized constructor
    public Person(String nameValue, int idValue){
        name = nameValue;
        id= idValue;
    }
}
class Calculation{
    public void add(int a, int b){
        System.out.println(a+b);
    }
    public void add(int a, int b, int c){
        System.out.println(a+b+c);
    }
    public void add(int a, int b, float c){
        System.out.println(a+b+c);
    }
    public void add(int a, float b, int c){
        System.out.println(a+b+c);
    }
}
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
		  Person p = new Person();
		  Person p1 = new Person("abcd",1);

        Calculation calc = new Calculation();
        //caller
		  calc.add(12,13);
        calc.add(12,13,14.5F);
    }
}

c. operator overloading: 
same operator, depending on the tyep of operands, do different kind of job.

int a = 10; int b = 20;
int result = a + b; //30

String firstName = "anil";
String lastName = "mishra"
String fullName = firstName + lastName; //anil mishra

B. dynamic polymorphism: where you will have same method in base as well as in child, but which object has been created during runtime, will decide which method will be called
1. involves minimum two classes: one base and a child
2. there will be no signature difference between the base and child class methods (makes it difficult for the compiler to decide which method will be called)
3. the difference between the methods lie in the implementation

child will override base implementation
Note: if the child do not have any new implementation, the base method will be invoked

					Person: Cut();

Butcher=>Person			HairStylist=>Person			FilmDirector=>Person
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cut(){}						Cut(){}								Cut(){}

Butcher b = new Butcher();
b.Cut();

HairStylist h = new HairStylist();
h.Cut();

FilmDirector f = new FilmDirector();
f.Cut();

A method in a class which is declared without a body (implementation) is known as abstract method
a class containing abstract method(s), is known as abstract class
You can't create instance of an abstract class
an abstract class can have non abstract methods too

DataAccess (using this class like a template other classes)
	public abstract void readData(); (Java)
	public void readData=0; (C++)

FileDataAccess => DataAccess
		public void readData(){//code}

OracleDataAccess => DataAccess
		public void readData(){//code}

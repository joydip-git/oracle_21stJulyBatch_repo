initializer block:
to initialize instance/static data members

perform operations in Java class:
1. constructor
2. regular method
3. block
	a. instance intializer block: 
		i. instance members as well as static members can be initialized
		ii. this is executed every time an instance is created
	b. static initializer block: 
		i. only static members can be initialized
		ii. this is executed ONLY ONE time, either when the first instance is created or you access a static member of the class for the very first time without creating any instance

chracaterestics:
a. block is executed when instance is created
b. block is executed after the base class ctor is invoked
c. block comes in the order in which they appear

Java Collection Framework:
Interfaces:
	Set, List, Queue, DeQue etc.
classes:
	ArrayList, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, Vector

									Iterable(i) => Iterator<T> iterator()		
															- hasNext()
															- next() 
															- remove()

									Collection(i)
											=> add, remove, removeIf(), size(), clear(), retainAll(), contains(), containsAll(), iterator, toArray(), isEmpty()

List(i)								Queue(i)						Set(i)

ArrayList	(c)						PriorityQueue(c)				HashSet (c)
LinkedList(c)					DeQueue(i)						LinkedHashSet (c)
Vector(c)								ArrayDeque(c)				SortedSet (i)
	Stack (c)																	TreeSet (c)
